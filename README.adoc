= Suptac
:toc:

This is an advanced implementation of tic-tac-toe which has some special rules.

== Rules

* the board has nine 3x3 boards like the board in the middle
* the boards are connected with each other
* the connections are tied to the previous move
* the first move is freely choosable
* after the first move the second player has to play in the board which has been marked by the first player

== How to run

This is still a wip and does not work yet
